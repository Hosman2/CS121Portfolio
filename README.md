# Project4
 In this project there is a banking system. It is the same banking system used in project 3. 
 However there is a new addition, if your account has a balance over 10,000 then you are granted
VIP access and that allows you to add personal notes. This is a new data structure implemented using HashMaps.
There is a new class that is an inheritance of the Customer class called the VIPCustomer.
If you are a VIPCustomer then you get a new menu that has new commands.


To use this application properly you must add an account and enter the information as propmted to(add more than 10,000 for your balance if you want to see the new changes).
You can then enter in single digits as prompted by the menu to make your decisions.
